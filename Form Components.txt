I understand—I'll lead with the specific projects you've personally developed to ground the UI documentation in your actual portfolio.

Project Portfolio: Veritas Design Form Components, Input Fields, Validation, and Form Layouts
I worked on the UI/UX architecture for Veritasor, Stellar-Save, Swift Remit, and Social Flow, focusing on bridging complex Web3 functionality with high-end fintech aesthetics. This design system represents the "pro-tech" standard I’ve established across these applications.

1. Core Input Fields
I developed these inputs to handle the precise data entry required for apps like Veritasor and Swift Remit:

Standard Text Inputs: Clean, 1px bordered containers with 8px corner radii for a modern feel.

Advanced Inputs: Integrated custom Select Dropdowns and Date Pickers to ensure consistent data formatting across the platform.

Multiline Textareas: Scalable fields for project details, featuring clear placeholder styles to guide user input.

2. Validation & Security Logic
In my work on the Veritasor registration flow, I implemented a robust validation system:

Real-time Feedback: Includes Success (Green/Checkmark) and Error (Red/Warning) states to minimize friction.

Password Intelligence: I designed a Segmented Strength Meter that provides instant visual confirmation as users meet security requirements—crucial for securing Web3 credentials.

3. Selection & System Controls
I streamlined the configuration process for Social Flow and Veritasor using these controls:

Selection States: Custom checkboxes and radio buttons for plan selection and weekly updates.

System Toggles: Smooth, iOS-style switches for global settings like Dark Mode and Push Notifications, ensuring the UI feels native and responsive.

4. Advanced Form Layouts
For the multi-step registration in Veritasor, I utilized a specific layout hierarchy:

Progress Tracking: A persistent "Step X of X" indicator with a percentage bar to reduce drop-off rates.

Action Placement: A "Sticky" bottom action bar containing Back and Continue/Save buttons to keep the primary goal always within reach.

5. File Upload & Management
I worked on a specialized upload module for document verification:

Drop Zones: A dashed-border area designed for high-visibility drag-and-drop interactions.

Progress Visualization: A linear bar showing real-time upload percentages (e.g., 80% uploaded) to maintain transparency during large file syncs.
